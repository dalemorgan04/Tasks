# Thought Stream

A large scale web app developed using ASP.NET MVC and NHibernate / Fluent

The app has a unique take on task management. The methodology has been based on the best tips from a collection of time management books. 

## Task Categories
The app can categorise tasks into the following types:

* **Thoughts** - 
Designed to be minimal and quick. The use of this is to capture any thought so that it can be organised at a more suitable time. When   a thought is written down the you can put aside any worry, knowing that you will make sure it is tended to when the time is more    appropriate
  
* **Tasks** - 
A task with a unique take on the due date. Tasks are allowed to be assigned a time frame as to when the task is due such as a particluar  week or month, rather than being forced to assign it an exact date or time. This freedom makes planning easier and quicker as far out    tasks can be quickly organised and left until the time is right to give them more thought.
  
* **Habits** - 
A recurring task. Seen as separate from a task so that when it comes to planning you can drop a habit onto as many days as you wish instead of being just one instance.
  
* **Milestones** - 
A collection of tasks. The idea of subtasks can be hidden and out of sight when they are stored within a task as done in other task management apps. Milestones give equal weight to tasks and subtasks but highlights collections. Can also be used to show a run of habits. Can be assigned to an already completed task to mark it as important. Milestones are given more wieght in you rhistory and highlight them when looking at your past achievements

* **Goals** - 
A project made up of tasks and milestones
  
## Task Management
* **Plan** - 
  Use drag and drop calendar cards to organise tasks onto days and bring in habits. Easily move a task or bring in unassigned tasks. Use goals to highlight groups of tasks
  
* **Do** -
  Quickly tick off tasks on the go
  
* **Review** -
  It is recommended to set aside time to regularly review your progress. A quick review at the end of the day, a longer review at the end of the week and then at the end of the month. By separately reviewing different time frames you get both a big picture idea of what you wish to accomplish and the specific steps of how to get there making anything appear achievable
  
* **Path of Achievements** -
  Your history will be kept in a timeline and dashboard. Being able to see all past achievements will show you how far you've come and what you've achieved in order to give you the motivation to carry on. Milestones are given more weight and can be assigned at any time. Going back in your history and adding milestones can help you build up a clear picture of your accomplishments and how you got to where you are similar to a diary
